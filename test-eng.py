Image-colored wordcloud
=======================

You can color a word-cloud by using an image-based coloring strategy
implemented in ImageColorGenerator. It uses the average color of the region
occupied by the word in a source image. You can combine this with masking -
pure-white will be interpreted as 'don't occupy' by the WordCloud object when
passed as mask.
If you want white as a legal color, you can just pass a different image to
"mask", but make sure the image shapes line up.
